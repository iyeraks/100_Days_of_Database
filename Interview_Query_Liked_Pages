Let’s say we want to build a naive recommender. We’re given two tables, one table called friends with a user_id and friend_id columns representing each user’s friends, and another table called page_likes with a user_id and a page_id representing the page each user liked.

Write an SQL query to create a metric to recommend pages for each user based on recommendations from their friend’s liked pages. 

Note: It shouldn’t recommend pages that the user already likes.

Example:

Input:

friends table

Column	Type
user_id	INTEGER
friend_id	INTEGER
page_likes table

Column	Type
user_id	INTEGER
page_id	INTEGER
Output:

Column	Type
user_id	INTEGER
page_id	INTEGER
num_friend_likes	INTEGER


Solution:

-- Users to their friends liked pages 
   with t1 as 
   ( select 
    f.user_id,
    f.friend_id,
    p.page_id
    from friends f 
    inner join page_likes p 
    on f.friend_id = p.user_id ) 

    select t1.user_id, t1.page_id, count(t1.friend_id)as num_friend_likes
    from t1
    join page_likes p
    on t1.page_id = p.page_id
    and t1.user_id = p.user_id 
    where p.user_id is not Null
    group by 1,2
